If you want to implement sass you need to compile it into normal css file, for this you have two Options: 
1. Install Sass with npm in your Local machine.
2. Get VS Code extention (preferd Way).

## This command will install sass into your machine.

```$sudo npm i -g  sass```

This will command will watch sass file and as soon as you make change in sass file it will reflect in css file.

```$sass --watch location/sassFile location/cssFile.```

 
 ## if you don't want to install sass you can also use VS Code Extension called live Sass Compiler.
